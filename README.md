# Stability Studio
Simple Python desktop app allowing you to make use of Huggingface's Diffuser based models. 
 
 ## Capabilities
  - Quickly draw a mask over an image and use a prompt to inpaint into that image
 
 ## Coming soon (or never)
  - Maybe support for other models
  - Fix the drag and drop
  - add an eraser tool because it's annoying. 
 
 
 ## Instructions
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install requirements*
   `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Execute program
   `python3 main.py`
 - For CUDA GPUs, you'll need to follow the instructions on Pytorch's website to install with the appropriate CUDA driver version.
 - Apple Silicon should work as is.
