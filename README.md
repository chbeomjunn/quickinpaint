# quickinpaint
 SImple python program that allows you to quickly inpaint using RunwayML's stable defusion inpainting model
 Pretty much just an interface for the model, allowing you to easily make a mask over the image.
 
 ## Capabilities
  - Quickly draw a mask over an image and use a prompt to inpaint into that image
 
 ## Coming soon (or never)
  - Maybe support for other models
  - Fix the drag and drop
  - add an eraser tool because it's annoying.

  2. Install requirements
